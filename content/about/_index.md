# 我叫朱利恩

My name is Lien Zhu.

Medicine $\bigcup$ Technology $\bigcup$ Culture

One idea I'm thinking about in my free time is sustainable city design. I have spent some time learning about different technical and cultural approaches to mobility and public services.

Public transportation and micromobility are critical in reducing our carbon footprint and improving our health.

I love to learn about ideas to promote public transportation, so please reach out to talk.
